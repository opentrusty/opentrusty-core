Instead, please report it via the following process:

1. Send an email to security@opentrusty.org (PLACEHOLDER).

3. We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix.

We follow a coordinated disclosure policy. Please allow us time to fix the issue before sharing it publicly.
